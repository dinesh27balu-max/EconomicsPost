      title: "The Return of Depression Economics – Summary + Analysis",
      content: `
        <p><strong>Chp 1:</strong><br>
        Popular economists like Robert Lucas and Eugene Fama believed in the efficient market hypothesis and claimed that the ‘central problem of depression prevention has been solved’. However, Krugman argues they were wrong because the world has become more interconnected and fragile, partly due to rising deregulation and speculative finance. He therefore believes that the faith in perfect markets actually helped set the stage for the 2008 crisis.</p>

        <p><strong>Chp 2:</strong><br>
        Krugman talks about the Latin America debt and currency crises by focusing on the Mexican Tequila Crisis, which occurred because Mexico and other Latin American countries borrowed heavily from foreign lenders in the US. They pegged their currency to the USD, but this made their currency overvalued. This happened because when you peg a currency like the peso to the USD, if the American economy improves, then the USD becomes more valuable, but this made the peso more valuable even though the Latin American economy did not improve as much as America’s. This led to the peso being valued more than it should be.</p>

        <p><strong>Chp 3:</strong><br>
        Krugman discusses the crash of Japan’s economy after its real-estate and stock bubbles burst in the 1990s. The central bank cut interest rates close to zero to encourage borrowing, but it did not work. Krugman’s solution was to print more money and create inflation expectations (make people believe that the prices of goods and services will increase later), this is so that they would be motivated to spend now.</p>

        <p><strong>Chp 4:</strong><br>
        Focuses on the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, where countries like Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and South Korea faced sudden collapses of their currencies and banking systems. In 1997, foreign investment flooded in, but much of this money went into speculating on assets (real estate and stock markets) and not into productive infrastructure like factories.<br>
        (Note – Ways money can come into a country from foreign investors:<br>
        1. Foreign investors deposit in banks, and banks lend money, and investors are paid interest.<br>
        2. Foreign investors convert their money into the local currency of a country to buy stocks and make money themselves instead of through interest.)<br>
        Asian countries also pegged their currencies to the USD to seem stable, but the strong dollar made exports expensive, hurting competitiveness, which made investors worry that these economies could not sustain their debts and pulled their money out. This led to capital flight. There was financial contagion too. Krugman believes that governments in these countries were slow to act and that listening to the IMF’s advice on austerity was wrong, as it made demand shrink. He thought the government should have increased spending and printed more money to restore confidence.</p>

        <p><strong>Chp 5:</strong><br>
        Krugman attacks the IMF and U.S. Treasury for their crisis management strategy. He thinks we should not cut spending and raise interest rates, this is because when governments cut spendings during a slump, the slump worsens, and when they raise interest rates to attract investors, it becomes harder to borrow. Together, these policies reduced demand.</p>

        <p><strong>Chp 6:</strong><br>
        Krugman blames complex financial models that supposedly eliminated risks for the financial crisis. One hedge fund he talked about is LTCM, which was run by two Nobel laureates and collapsed in 1998. He also talks about how markets are not always rational and are driven by herd psychology. Krugman hints at the idea that the public overrated the Fed’s ability to control the financial market, which created a new form of moral hazard.</p>

        <p><strong>Chp 7:</strong><br>
        Talks about Alan Greenspan and his belief in laissez-faire capitalism and market self-regulation. Krugman says this belief led to two bubbles: the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s and the housing bubble in the early 2000s. People compared Greenspan with reducing the impact of the dot-com bubble but did not criticise him for letting it form. After the dot-com bubble crashed, Greenspan kept interest rates low. This led to cheap borrowing and massive housing speculation. Banks lent relentlessly, assuming housing prices would always increase. This created a bubble, which eventually led to the 2008 financial crisis when it burst.</p>

        <p><strong>Chp 8:</strong><br>
        Talks about the shadow banking system, such as investment banks and money market funds. Traditional banks are insured and regulated, but shadow banks are not. So, when the price of houses decreased, panic hit. Repo lenders refused to roll over loans and demanded more collateral. Investment banks were forced to sell MBS for money, but everyone was trying to do the same, thus the price of MBS fell, leading to a cycle and the credit market freezing. Krugman argues that the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999, which separated commercial and investment banking, allowed this shadow system to grow unchecked.</p>

        <p><strong>Chp 9:</strong><br>
        Krugman talks about the similarities between the crises that have occurred in the past and the 2008 collapse. The collapse was a combination of past economic disasters.</p>

        <p><strong>Chp 10:</strong><br>
        Krugman says the problems of a depression have returned and argues that economists and policymakers became too focused on the supply side and neglected demand-side issues. Krugman calls for two actions: recapitalising banks to restore lending and a large-scale Keynesian fiscal stimulus, including public spending on infrastructure and support for local governments to boost demand. He argues that economic slumps are not caused by a lack of resources but by a lack of understanding and will. In depression economics, there is a free lunch - idle workers and factories waiting to be used - and the real challenge is overcoming outdated ideas and acting boldly to restore demand stability.</p>

        <p><strong>Critical Analysis:</strong><br>
        Krugman attacks Greenspan and the Bush administration for “malign neglect”, arguing that their faith in markets blinded them to systemic fragility. However, I would argue that Krugman underestimates how difficult it was for regulators to foresee the crisis in real time, as the shadow banking system was vast and opaque, and even if investors had been more careful, we cannot conclude that the crisis could have been prevented.</p>

        <p>Another potential limitation of Krugman's analysis is his treatment of financial innovation as harmful. He fails to showcase how it has helped modern finance, such as how MBS allowed banks to issue new loans more quickly, which improved liquidity in the market.</p>

        <p>Krugman's discussion about a moral hazard forming due to the public's perception that the Federal Reserve can control the market however it wants is still relevant today. Central banks have to provide stability without encouraging risk-taking behaviour.</p>
