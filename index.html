      title: "The Unemployment Crisis in the UK", 
      content: `
        <p>The unemployment rate in the UK rose to 5% in the three months to September, and this is only expected to rise.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Why this happened:</strong></p>
        
        <p>It is perhaps useful to look closely at what has led to the rise in unemployment in the past year. A potential reason could be the increase in Secondary Class 1 National Insurance Contribution, which went from 13.8% to 15%. This means that employers must pay more tax per employee, although the Employment Allowance changes reduced the impact for small businesses, it did not fully offset the higher NIC rate for medium to large employers, who make up most of total employment. This means that the total cost of employment increased. As a result, there were hiring restraints, this is because firms mainly wanted to adjust to this change through a decrease in hiring to support existent staff who had already had the training needed for the job.</p>
        
        <p>Additionally, UK's productivity rate has remained the same for the past 3 years, while UK's inflation rate has remained above the 2% level for most of this time. To keep employees' real wages from falling, businesses increased nominal wages, thus, labour cost per worker has increased but output per worker has not, meaning firms had to choose between greater price for their products (which could decrease demand) or cut costs by reducing workforce. This meant that some firms have had to lay off workers to manage their finance, which has also contributed to the increase in unemployment rate.</p>
        
        <p>Economic inactivity has also surged, with approximately 2.8 million people classified as long-term sick as of Q3 2025. Although the reason for this is not clear, it could potentially be because of post-pandemic health impacts such as depression and anxiety.</p>
        
        <p>Although cutting interest rates might stimulate hiring, this approach carries the risk of reigniting inflation. The trade-off between potential job creation and the unemployment that could result from renewed price pressures makes this policy lever particularly uncertain.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Future outlook:</strong></p>
        
        <p>Even though efforts are being made to reduce unemployment, the Employment Rights Bill that is currently under review may in fact exacerbate this problem.</p>
        
        <p>For example, one of the policy changes is increased dismissal protection for industrial action which will be implemented sometime in 2025 will mean that dismissal for taking part in industrial action becomes automatically unfair, and the current 12-week limit is removed. This means that workers can strike indefinitely without the risk of job loss, making strikes more disruptive for firms. As a result, operational costs will increase and damage the reputation of the firm for reliable service, which incentivises firms to increase their investment in automating their process and decrease hiring human workers.</p>
        
        <p>Perhaps even more significant is the proposal to make unfair dismissal protection a day-one right, slated for 2027. Currently, workers must complete two years of service before gaining this protection. Now, every new hire needs to be carefully considered, so firms will only be willing to hire workers who they deem will work to a "certain" standard. Therefore, young workers with no experience or long-term unemployed may be rejected, which will add to the unemployment crisis the UK is facing.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p>
        
        <p>I believe that although the unemployment crisis seems to be spiralling out of control, with effective policy changes that addresses the key issues that workers face without discouraging firms from hiring workers, the UK can recover from this. Although, I agree that it is easier said than done, with firm government commitment and a demonstration of political competence, both employees and employers may gain the confidence needed to invest in the future. Reducing uncertainty in the business environment could, in itself, become a powerful catalyst for job creation and economic stability.</p>

      title: "Why Nations Fail - Summary + Analysis",
      content: `
        <p><strong>Preface</strong><br>
        The preface focuses on the global differences in wealth and living standards between rich and poor countries, and it uses the Arab Spring as an example to show how poverty and corruption fuelled public anger. It tells us that protestors understood that the real problem was a lack of political rights and accountability, not geography, culture or lack of knowledge. The authors argue that nations remain poor because of extractive political institutions (where a small elite control power and wealth), and the book uses Mubarak's Egypt as an example of this. We are told that rich countries like England and the U.S. became prosperous after political revolutions improved rights and created inclusive institutions. Meanwhile, Egypt's past revolutions only swapped one elite for another, leaving the system unchanged.</p>

        <p><strong>Chp 1:</strong><br>
        Chapter 1 explores why some nations become rich while others stay poor. It uses the example of Nogales in the U.S. and Mexico to highlight how different institutions create different outcomes. This chapter explains that political institutions shape economic institutions, which in turn determine the incentives for innovation and investment. In the U.S., political power was distributed and an environment that encouraged innovation was created, helping inventors like Edison and entrepreneurs like Bill Gates succeed. However, in Mexico, concentrated political power created extractive institutions. This meant that only the elites in society controlled wealth, and access to resources and opportunities for others was blocked. An example of this was the monopoly in the landline and broadband industry by Carlos Slim's Telmex. These institutional differences between places explain why there is global inequality. This chapter basically argues that inclusive institutions are necessary for sustained prosperity and that politics determines whether there is economic success.</p>

        <p><strong>Chp 2:</strong><br>
        Chapter 2 explains why traditional explanations of global inequality, such as geography, culture and ignorance, fail to explain the gaps in prosperity between countries. The geography hypothesis fails because climate and soil quality cannot explain large differences within similar regions, and we saw this in Chapter 1 through the example of Nogales. The culture hypothesis (which includes arguments about religion and work ethic) fails because similar cultures can produce very different outcomes, for example, North vs. South Korea. The ignorance hypothesis (that poor nations are simply mismanaged due to a lack of knowledge) fails because political leaders often make choices that protect their power over the economic growth of their nation. This chapter argues that inequality persists because of political institutions and those in power, and it explains how politics and the institutional structures of nations can clarify why some countries prosper while others do not.</p>

        <p><strong>Chp 3:</strong><br>
        Chapter 3 explores why some countries grow rich while others stay poor by emphasising the importance of institutions. It uses North vs. South Korea to show how inclusive institutions (property rights and education) support growth, while extractive ones lead to poverty. This chapter says that political institutions influence economic institutions. Pluralistic, centralised states create inclusive institutions, while authoritarian systems create extractive ones. Examples such as the Kingdom of Kongo and modern China are used to show how extractive institutions can produce short bursts of growth but that this is not sustainable. This chapter argues that long-term, sustainable prosperity requires both inclusive political and economic institutions working together, as this encourages innovation and leads to a greater distribution of power.</p>

        <p><strong>Chp 4:</strong><br>
        Chapter 4 examines how small institutional differences, when combined with major events, produced has led to today's global inequalities. England is used as an example of inclusive institutions to demonstrate how its societal structure allowed it to take advantage of the economic opportunities such as Atlantic trade and the Industrial Revolution. Meanwhile, in Africa, Latin America and the Middle East, extractive institutions hindered innovations and concentrated wealth and power in the hands of a few. Colonialism and social hierarchies strengthened these extractive systems. Events like the Black Death and the rise of global trade acted as critical junctures, but the outcomes of these depended on the pre-existing institutions and chance. Over time, inclusive institutions created virtuous circles of growth, while extractive institutions reinforced vicious circles of stagnation, this explains why some regions prospers while others lagged behind.</p>

        <p><strong>Chp 5:</strong><br>
        Chapter 5 delves into the idea of how extractive institutions can produce short-term economic growth by organising agriculture, labour and trade, but the growth is limited and unstable. To strengthen this concept, examples from the Kuba Kingdom and Maya city-states are used. Extractive institutions discourage innovation and create inequality. This chapter shows how long-term prosperity requires inclusive institutions that encourage people to innovate and secure property rights, while extractive systems can only provide temporary gains.</p>

        <p><strong>Chp 6:</strong><br>
        Chapter 6 explores the rise and fall of Roman institutions and their economic effects. During the Republic, partially inclusive structures, such as plebeian assemblies, allowed for some economic opportunities and technological advancements. However, the concentration of power in the Senate and emperors led to increased slavery and innovations were suppressed, creating an extractive institution. The collapse of Western Rome caused economic decline and institutional fragmentation, which resulted in feudalism in Europe. Although this hindered growth, it also allowed independent cities and commercially minded groups to emerge in England. Institutional drift and critical junctures to the formation of inclusive institutions, which enabled industrialisation to occur. Comparisons are made with other regions, such as Ethiopia, to show how similar early prosperity does not guarantee sustained growth or inclusive institutions.</p>

        <p><strong>Chp 7:</strong><br>
        Chapter 7 talks about how England's political and economic institutions enabled the Industrial Revolution. The Glorious Revolution of 1688 ended Stuart absolutism and strengthened Parliament. This led to a pluralistic political system with broad representation and greater property rights. The rise of inclusive institutions meant that there was an abolition of domestic monopolies, the protection of property rights, and the creation of the Bank of England, as well as land and tax reforms. These changes encouraged investment and innovation. This chapter includes examples of these reforms being implemented, such as the Royal African Company losing its monopoly. There are also examples that demonstrate how technological innovations thrived, such as James Watt's steam engine and Cartwright's power loom. This chapter explains how creative destruction redistributed wealth and political power, leading to reforms like the First Reform Act of 1832 and the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1846. England's institutional drift and historical contingencies (unexpected events or chance occurrences) allowed it to industrialize.</p>

        <p><strong>Chp 8:</strong><br>
        Chapter 8 shows how different institutions shaped global inequality during the Industrial Revolution. Inclusive institutions promoted investment and innovation, while extractive institutions blocked development by concentrating power among elites. Russia, under Nicholas I, banned factories and railways and prevented the formation of large worker concentrations out of fear of unrest, which restricted industrialization. Ethiopia had extreme absolutism, as emperors controlled land and resources, kept peasants dependent, and maintained extractive institutions for centuries, resulting in poverty and stunted industrialization. Conversely, Somalia lacked political centralization altogether, which meant that there were weak property rights, low investment, and conflict. This chapter illustrates how extractive institutions create stagnation and suffering, while inclusive systems support innovation, such as Edison's lightbulb and Arkwright's factory system. Ultimately, we are told that political centralization and inclusive institutions are needed for industrialization and lasting prosperity, while absolutism, extractive institutions, or dispersed authority lead to poverty and prevent economic growth.</p>

        <p><strong>Chp 9:</strong><br>
        Chapter 9 explores how extractive institutions increased global inequality and underdevelopment. In West and Central Africa, the Atlantic slave trade turned states like Oyo into societies that centred on warfare and captured people for slavery, which led to a large loss of population and disrupted the structure of society. After the slave trade ended, African states shifted from selling people to selling goods, but they still used forced labour to maintain their economies and power. In southern Africa (Ciskei and Transkei), early economic growth emerged when the introduction of private property reduced the chiefs' authority, demonstrating that more inclusive institutions could promote development. European colonial policies in South Africa undid earlier progress, for example, the Natives Land Act (1913) took land from Africans, the homelands system and dual economy forced them to provide cheap labour for white-owned businesses. Racial laws and the Bantu Education Act limited their education and skills. This chapter shows that economic growth in some regions relied on the deliberate underdevelopment of others.</p>

        <p><strong>Chp 10:</strong><br>
        Chapter 10 examines the historical emergence of inclusive institutions and their role in global inequality, for example, early colonies like Sydney in Australia and Jamestown in Virginia developed inclusive institutions because they lacked exploitable native populations or precious resources. In England, the Glorious Revolution created inclusive institutions which allowed for the Industrial Revolution to occur, and in France, the French Revolution abolished feudalism, and Napoleon spread reforms to countries like Belgium and Switzerland. However, in China, centralised absolutism resisted reform, which meant that it remained stagnant. This chapter argues for the idea that modern inequality stems from historical institutional paths, which meant that nations with inclusive institutions embraced industrialisation, while those with extractive institutions encountered stunted growth and development.</p>

        <p><strong>Chp 11:</strong><br>
        Chapter 11 shows how inclusive political and economic institutions create a virtuous circle that promotes reform and stability. In Britain, the Glorious Revolution (1688) established pluralism and rule of law, this limited arbitrary power. Further reforms like the First Reform Act of 1832 and universal education led to greater social benefits for those who had little power before. In the U.S., inclusive institutions were strengthened by the Constitution and the expansion of voting rights. In the late 1800s, large monopolies threatened economic inclusivity, but grassroots movements and laws like the Sherman and Clayton Antitrust Acts restored competition. FDR's New Deal showed that even when a president had popular support, institutions could limit power and preserve institutional stability. Meanwhile, Argentina's extractive institutions allowed leaders like Menem to have a large control over the judiciary and politics. This chapter argues that inclusive political and economic institutions, once established, can reinforce each other.</p>

        <p><strong>Chp 12:</strong><br>
        Chapter 12 talks about the vicious circle of extractive institutions. One example used to show this was how in the Southern U.S., wealthy plantation owners preserved extractive institutions even after slavery ended. They used Jim Crow laws, Black Codes and voting restrictions to control labour and politics, showing how extractive institutions can persist despite changes to the societal structure. Across sub-Saharan Africa, postcolonial leaders such as Siaka Stevens in Sierra Leone and Laurent Kabila in the Congo inherited or recreated extractive structures, often worsening exploitation. This chapter shows how extractive systems produce a negative feedback loop, which means that there are instability and poverty.</p>

        <p><strong>Chp 13:</strong><br>
        Chapter 13 examines the persistence of extractive institutions across countries. For example, in North Korea, the communist government kept most people poor while the elites got rich by controlling the economy, changing the currency and punishing black-market activity. In Egypt, after Nasser, Mubarak allowed politically connected businessmen to dominate industries and profit from privatisation, while 40% of people remained in poverty. Effectively, extractive institutions create a cycle where those in power take wealth, which keeps them in power, making change very hard. The chapter explains that how elites extract wealth differs across time and region, but the results (poverty and inequality) always remain the same. Even though extractive institutions last a long time, the chapter stresses that they are not immutable.</p>

        <p><strong>Chp 14:</strong><br>
        Chapter 14 explains how societies can break the cycle of extractive institutions through critical junctures, existing institutions, leadership and contingency. In Botswana, for example, Tswana chiefs Khama, Bathoen and Sebele convinced Britain to block Cecil Rhodes from taking their lands in 1895. Botswana's traditional institutions, which included a centralised authority and the kgotla (community assembly), helped support inclusive development. After independence in 1966, leaders like Seretse Khama and Quett Masire created stable, inclusive institutions and used diamond wealth to benefit the whole country. Furthermore, in China, Mao built very extractive systems through collectivisation, the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. After his death in 1976, a critical juncture opened. Deng Xiaoping then introduced reforms like the household responsibility system (this let families farm their own plots and keep their profits), decentralisation of state enterprises by giving local governments and factory managers more control over decisions, and transitioned to a more market-based pricing system for goods and services, this led to partial economic inclusivity although political power still remained extractive. This chapter emphasises the idea that nations can escape extractive systems when big events combine with supportive institutions, good leadership and favourable contingency, showing how history influences the possibilities that could occur in the future but that it does not dictate it completely.</p>

        <p><strong>Chp 15:</strong><br>
        Chapter 15 explores how inclusive institutions and pluralism support sustained economic growth, rather than modernisation, foreign aid or authoritarian rule. We are told that rich, educated countries like Germany and Japan still experienced authoritarianism and extractive institutions, showing how the modernisation theory is flawed. Foreign aid usually fails to change institutions because elites often take it or misuse it, as seen in Afghanistan and sub-Saharan Africa, while humanitarian aid can reduce suffering, it cannot build inclusive institutions. Conversely, empowering large groups of people drives lasting political change, for example, in Brazil, labour and social movements led to greater education and reduced inequality. Additionally, media plays a crucial role in informing society, as censorship in authoritarian regimes such as China preserves extractive control. Ultimately, this chapter argues that empowering people, pluralism and inclusive political institutions are needed for inclusive economic growth, and that real change depends 'on the history of economic and political institutions, on many small differences that matter and on the very contingent path of history.'</p>

        <p><strong>Critical Analysis</strong><br>
        Acemoglu and Robinson argue that only inclusive institutions can sustain long-term prosperity, yet several modern examples challenge this idea. For example, China, under the authoritarian Communist Party, grew rapidly. The CCP maintained tight political control but introduced partial economic inclusivity, allowing for private enterprises to exist and global trade integration. This combined with strong state capacity, such as competent bureaucracy and large-scale infrastructure investment (building roads and bridges), has led to productivity and innovation, even without political pluralism. This shows us how inclusivity is not the only path to prosperity, and that state capability and effective policies can act as a substitute for political inclusivity.<br> </p>

       <p> While this book focuses on internal politics, it does not emphasise to the extent that it should about how history and the global economy affect a nation's outcome. Many African countries had extractive systems in place from colonial rule, with economies built to export raw materials rather than internal development. This meant that after independence, the local elites replaced Europeans in controlling the economy. This meant that the elites still kept most of the profits for themselves and prevented broader economic development, even when new leaders sought reform. This shows the extent to which a nation is affected by its institutional history and global structures, and how this can trap a nation in a cycle of underdevelopment.</p>

      title: "The Return of Depression Economics - Summary + Analysis",
      content: `
        <p><strong>Chp 1:</strong><br>
        Popular economists like Robert Lucas and Eugene Fama believed in the efficient market hypothesis and claimed that the 'central problem of depression prevention has been solved'. However, Krugman argues they were wrong because the world has become more interconnected and fragile, partly due to rising deregulation and speculative finance. He therefore believes that the faith in perfect markets actually helped set the stage for the 2008 crisis.</p>

        <p><strong>Chp 2:</strong><br>
        Krugman talks about the Latin America debt and currency crises by focusing on the Mexican Tequila Crisis, which occurred because Mexico and other Latin American countries borrowed heavily from foreign lenders in the US. They pegged their currency to the USD, but this made their currency overvalued. This happened because when you peg a currency like the peso to the USD, if the American economy improves, then the USD becomes more valuable, but this made the peso more valuable even though the Latin American economy did not improve as much as America's. This led to the peso being valued more than it should be.</p>

        <p><strong>Chp 3:</strong><br>
        Krugman discusses the crash of Japan's economy after its real-estate and stock bubbles burst in the 1990s. The central bank cut interest rates close to zero to encourage borrowing, but it did not work. Krugman's solution was to print more money and create inflation expectations (make people believe that the prices of goods and services will increase later), this is so that they would be motivated to spend now.</p>

        <p><strong>Chp 4:</strong><br>
        Focuses on the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, where countries like Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and South Korea faced sudden collapses of their currencies and banking systems. In 1997, foreign investment flooded in, but much of this money went into speculating on assets (real estate and stock markets) and not into productive infrastructure like factories.<br>
        (Note – Ways money can come into a country from foreign investors:<br>
        1. Foreign investors deposit in banks, and banks lend money, and investors are paid interest.<br>
        2. Foreign investors convert their money into the local currency of a country to buy stocks and make money themselves instead of through interest.)<br>
        Asian countries also pegged their currencies to the USD to seem stable, but the strong dollar made exports expensive, hurting competitiveness, which made investors worry that these economies could not sustain their debts and pulled their money out. This led to capital flight. There was financial contagion too. Krugman believes that governments in these countries were slow to act and that listening to the IMF's advice on austerity was wrong, as it made demand shrink. He thought the government should have increased spending and printed more money to restore confidence.</p>

        <p><strong>Chp 5:</strong><br>
        Krugman attacks the IMF and U.S. Treasury for their crisis management strategy. He thinks we should not cut spending and raise interest rates, this is because when governments cut spendings during a slump, the slump worsens, and when they raise interest rates to attract investors, it becomes harder to borrow. Together, these policies reduced demand.</p>

        <p><strong>Chp 6:</strong><br>
        Krugman blames complex financial models that supposedly eliminated risks for the financial crisis. One hedge fund he talked about is LTCM, which was run by two Nobel laureates and collapsed in 1998. He also talks about how markets are not always rational and are driven by herd psychology. Krugman hints at the idea that the public overrated the Fed's ability to control the financial market, which created a new form of moral hazard.</p>

        <p><strong>Chp 7:</strong><br>
        Talks about Alan Greenspan and his belief in laissez-faire capitalism and market self-regulation. Krugman says this belief led to two bubbles: the dot-com bubble in the late 1990s and the housing bubble in the early 2000s. People compared Greenspan with reducing the impact of the dot-com bubble but did not criticise him for letting it form. After the dot-com bubble crashed, Greenspan kept interest rates low. This led to cheap borrowing and massive housing speculation. Banks lent relentlessly, assuming housing prices would always increase. This created a bubble, which eventually led to the 2008 financial crisis when it burst.</p>

        <p><strong>Chp 8:</strong><br>
        Talks about the shadow banking system, such as investment banks and money market funds. Traditional banks are insured and regulated, but shadow banks are not. So, when the price of houses decreased, panic hit. Repo lenders refused to roll over loans and demanded more collateral. Investment banks were forced to sell MBS for money, but everyone was trying to do the same, thus the price of MBS fell, leading to a cycle and the credit market freezing. Krugman argues that the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999, which separated commercial and investment banking, allowed this shadow system to grow unchecked.</p>

        <p><strong>Chp 9:</strong><br>
        Krugman talks about the similarities between the crises that have occurred in the past and the 2008 collapse. The collapse was a combination of past economic disasters.</p>

        <p><strong>Chp 10:</strong><br>
        Krugman says the problems of a depression have returned and argues that economists and policymakers became too focused on the supply side and neglected demand-side issues. Krugman calls for two actions: recapitalising banks to restore lending and a large-scale Keynesian fiscal stimulus, including public spending on infrastructure and support for local governments to boost demand. He argues that economic slumps are not caused by a lack of resources but by a lack of understanding and will. In depression economics, there is a free lunch - idle workers and factories waiting to be used - and the real challenge is overcoming outdated ideas and acting boldly to restore demand stability.</p>

        <p><strong>Critical Analysis:</strong><br>
        Krugman attacks Greenspan and the Bush administration for "malign neglect", arguing that their faith in markets blinded them to systemic fragility. However, I would argue that Krugman underestimates how difficult it was for regulators to foresee the crisis in real time, as the shadow banking system was vast and opaque, and even if investors had been more careful, we cannot conclude that the crisis could have been prevented.</p>

        <p>Another potential limitation of Krugman's analysis is his treatment of financial innovation as harmful. He fails to showcase how it has helped modern finance, such as how MBS allowed banks to issue new loans more quickly, which improved liquidity in the market.</p>

        <p>Krugman's discussion about a moral hazard forming due to the public's perception that the Federal Reserve can control the market however it wants is still relevant today. Central banks have to provide stability without encouraging risk-taking behaviour.</p>
